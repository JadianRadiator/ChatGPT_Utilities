To combine your pseudo save/select functionality with your PyQt .ui file, you need to integrate the generated Python code from the .ui file with your main PyQt application script. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Create Your .ui File:

Design your GUI using Qt Designer and save it as a .ui file.

### 2. Convert .ui to Python Code:

In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your .ui file, and run:

```bash
pyuic5 your_design.ui -o generated_code.py
```

Replace `your_design.ui` with your actual .ui file's name and `generated_code.py` with the desired Python code file.

### 3. Write the Pseudo Save/Select Functions:

Write your pseudo save/select functions in your main PyQt application script. Here's an example based on the previous snippets:

```python
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QFileDialog
from generated_code import Ui_MainWindow

class MyApplication(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.ui = Ui_MainWindow()
        self.ui.setupUi(self)

        # Connect pseudo save/select functions to buttons
        self.ui.saveButton.clicked.connect(self.pseudo_save_function)
        self.ui.selectButton.clicked.connect(self.pseudo_select_function)

    def pseudo_save_function(self):
        options = QFileDialog.Options()
        options |= QFileDialog.DontUseNativeDialog
        save_path, _ = QFileDialog.getSaveFileName(self, "Save File", "", "All Files (*);;Text Files (*.txt)", options=options)

        if save_path:
            print(f"File saved to: {save_path}")

    def pseudo_select_function(self):
        options = QFileDialog.Options()
        options |= QFileDialog.DontUseNativeDialog
        selected_path = QFileDialog.getExistingDirectory(self, "Select Folder", "", options=options)

        if selected_path:
            print(f"Selected Folder: {selected_path}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = MyApplication()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

### 4. Run Your Application:

Run your Python script. The PyQt application window should appear with the designed GUI, and the pseudo save/select functions should be triggered when the corresponding buttons are clicked.

This way, you've combined your PyQt .ui file with the pseudo save/select functionality in a single PyQt application script. Adjust the code as needed based on your specific requirements.
